Contiguous Arrayy

Problem Statement

Contiguous Array

Given a binary array 'nums', you must find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that contains an equal number of Os and Is.

Explanation:

A binary array is an array that contains only Os and Is.

â€¢ A subarray is any subset of the indices of the original array.

A contiguous subarray is one in which all the elements are consecutive, i.e... any element between the first and last element of the subarray is also part of it.

Examples:

Input : nums [0, 1]

Output: 2

Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of Os and Is is [0, 1] with a length of 2.

Input: nums = [0, 1, 0]

Output: 2

Explanation: The longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of Os and Is is either [0, 1] or [1, Ol, both with a length of 2.

Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
